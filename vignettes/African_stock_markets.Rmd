```{r, include = FALSE}
knitr::opts_chunk$set(
  collapse = TRUE,
  comment = "  "
)
```

```{r setup}
library(AfricanStockMarkets)

```

there are several types of data in this package:

first we have a set of data on the indices of the various African stock markets

```{r}
knitr::kable(head(indices))

summary(indices)
```


Then we have a set of data on company shares by stock market. 
Example that of NIGERIA:

```{r}
knitr::kable(head(share_NGA), format = 'html', caption = "Value of NIGERIA companies shares" )

summary(share_NGA)

```

Finally, we have a set of data on bonds by stock market. 
Example that of South Africa:

```{r}
knitr::kable(head(bonds_AZF), format = 'html', caption = "Value of NIGERIA stock market bonds")

summary(bonds_AZF)

```
